# <h1>Travel app- Capstone project for Udacity's Front-End Web developer nanodegree Program</h1> 
<br>

<h2>Project goal and summary</h2>
This project's goal was to develop a travel app in which the user types a desired travel location(a city) and a date of departure. If the day of departure is in the next 16 days the user gets a predicted weather forecast and if its after he/she will get the current weather displayed in Â°C an an icon matching the description of the weather. The user will also see in which country is the city that he/she chose and which currency do they use. The user is able to save and delete the trips from the Front-End.
